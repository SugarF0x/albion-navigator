# Albion Navigator

**Albion Navigator** (**AN**) is a _Roads of Avalon_ cartography management tool.
It helps in taking nots on portals as well as in managing them.

## Cartography

Cartography tab is where all the mapping takes place. New portals can be registered here.

### Portal Registrations

Start typing cluster or road name in either of the text fields. Auto-complete will suggest
an appropriate name. Invalid names disallow registration.

You can cycle between suggested auto-completions by pressing **Up** and **Down** arrows.
You don't need to fill the name out completely - the name suggested by auto-complete will be used.

Specifying expiration time marks this portal connection for removal in given time from the moment
of registration. Thus, registering a portal with 10 minutes specified will have it removed in 10
minutes.

If a portal is being added from a screen capture, then the time difference between what has been
entered and when the capture has been taken is automatically accounted for (see [Screen Captures](#Screen-Captures))

### Screen Captures

_Currently supported on windows only. I probably will not bother with other platforms but feel free to contribute._

When the app is running, pressing **Ctrl + S** takes a screenshot of the primary monitor.
This can be used to take quick snaps of portals and their timers to write the findings down later
when back in a safe environment. 

Snaps also provide timestamp on when it was taken. This data is automatically accounted for when
registering a portal connection from a snap. Thus, entering a portal of 9 hours about 10 minutes
after having taken a snap will register it as a portal of 8 hours 50 minutes respectively.
